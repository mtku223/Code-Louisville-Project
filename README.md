# CODE LOUISVILLE FRONT_END WEBSITE
This website is a prelimenary design for a company website. The company is local louisville t-shirt company that works with varius businesses locally and across the country.
It was my goal to focus on design and functionality across all platforms. As well as create a website that has important resources for prospective clients.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WHERE THEY CAN BE FOUND

#### HTML FILES: 
There are a number of basic HTML files.

#### CSS: 
There is one main.css file that covers all the pages found in my project, It is not organized, optimized, or DRY necessarily, but it does reference my abilities with CSS

#### Responsive: 
Can be found around line 388, there are 3 break points which are based around when the layout started to break

#### Comments:
You will see comments throughout, however they are probably not as noticable or in depth as they should be.

#### Front-end Framework:
This project incorporates multiple jquery and javascript expressions. Within the head of the Index.html you will see a javscript formula that allows for an instagram feed at the bottom of the page.
Added to the instagram feed you will see a navigation respond "on-scroll" in the js.js file. Also within this file is a Jquery snippet which I edited to make a responsive hamburger menu (made before I new about bootstrap).
