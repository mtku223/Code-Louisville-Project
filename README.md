# CODE LOUISVILLE FRONT_END WEBSITE
This website is a prelimenary design for a company website. The company is local louisville t-shirt company that works with varius businesses locally and across the country.
It was my goal to focus on design and functionality across all platforms. As well as create a website that has important resources for prospective clients.

To visit the site, simply run index.html (I tried to get the website going using github pages but couldn't get it to work, you can see that there is a gh-pages branch).

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WHERE THEY CAN BE FOUND

#### HTML FILES: 
There are a number of basic HTML files.

#### CSS: 
There is one main.css file that covers all the pages found in my project, It is not organized, optimized, or DRY necessarily, but it does reference my abilities with CSS

#### Responsive: 
Can be found around line 388, there are 3 break points which are based around when the layout started to break

#### Comments:
You will see comments throughout, however they are probably not as noticable or in depth as they should be.

#### Front-end Framework:
This project incorporates multiple jquery and javascript expressions. Within the head of the Index.html you will see a javscript formula that allows for an instagram feed at the bottom of the page.
Added to the instagram feed you will see a navigation respond "on-scroll" in the js.js file. Also within this file is a Jquery snippet which I edited to make a responsive hamburger menu (made before I new about bootstrap).


###### Notes:
There are quite a few unused files in the directory because I didn't not finish a page I would haved liked to include. However, my project should still meet all requirements without the pages referenced in the live site.

The navigation and hamburger menu were created before I completed the Framwork basics class. The way I used Jquery for the navigation allows for the items to be responsive but they do not respond to the resize of a window. They are only responsive on reload. I tried incorporate bootstrap however the layout of the rest of my page changed and I did not have time to edit and troubleshoot, so I reverted by to the older design.
